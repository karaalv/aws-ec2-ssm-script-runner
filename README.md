# aws-ec2-ssm-script-runner ⛓️

**Release status**: Unreleased. Use `main` until a version is published.

Reusable GitHub Action for executing scripts on AWS EC2 instances via
AWS Systems Manager (SSM). Designed for secure, repeatable CI and
infrastructure automation without SSH access.

## 🔭 Overview

This action executes shell scripts on EC2 instances using
AWS SSM Run Command (`AWS-RunShellScript`).

It is intended for use in CI pipelines and infrastructure workflows
where direct SSH access is undesirable or unavailable.

## ⚙️ How it works

1. GitHub Actions assumes an AWS IAM role (via OIDC or static credentials)
2. The AWS region is set by `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials`
3. The action resolves the target EC2 instance by **instance ID or Name tag**
4. The script is pulled from AWS S3 on the target EC2 instance via SSM
5. The script is executed using `AWS-RunShellScript`
6. Command status and output are streamed back to the workflow

## ☑️ Requirements

### EC2 instance

- SSM Agent installed and running
- Instance IAM role with:
  - `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore`
  - Permission to read the specified S3 bucket

### GitHub Actions

- AWS credentials configured using:
  - `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials`
- The AWS region **must** be set via `configure-aws-credentials`
  - The action will fail fast if no region is configured
- IAM permissions:
  - `ssm:SendCommand`
  - `ssm:GetCommandInvocation`
  - `ec2:DescribeInstances`

## 🏗️ Usage

Either `instance-id` **or** `instance-name` must be provided.
If both are provided, `instance-id` takes precedence.

```yaml
- name: Run script on EC2
  uses: karaalv/aws-ec2-ssm-script-runner@main
  with:
    instance-name: accounting-staging
    bucket-name: ${{ vars.AWS_ACCOUNT_ID }}-scripts
    script-location: infra/deploy/rollout.sh
    env-vars-for-script: |
      GIT_BRANCH=${{ github.ref_name }}
      DEPLOY_ENV=prod
      SOME_FLAG=true
```

## ➡️ Inputs

| Name                   | Required | Default | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|----------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `instance-id`          | No       | `""`    | EC2 instance ID. Takes precedence if both ID and name are provided.          |
| `instance-name`        | No       | `""`    | Value of the EC2 `Name` tag. Must resolve to exactly one running instance.   |
| `bucket-name`          | Yes      | —       | S3 bucket containing the script.                                            |
| `script-location`      | Yes      | —       | S3 key (path) of the script within the bucket.                              |
| `env-vars-for-script`  | No       | `""`    | Newline-separated environment variables exported before executing the script|
| `script-name`          | No       | `""`    | Optional local filename override. Defaults to `basename(script-location)`.  |
| `poll-interval-seconds`| No       | `5`     | Seconds between polling SSM for command status.                              |
| `timeout-seconds`      | No       | `1800`  | Maximum seconds to wait before the action fails.                             |

## 🏡 Environment variables

Environment variables passed to the script **must** be provided in
`KEY=VALUE` notation, separated by newlines.

Example:

```yaml
env-vars-for-script: |
  APP_ENV=production
  LOG_LEVEL=info
  DEPLOY_VERSION=2026-01-11
```
